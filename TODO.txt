1. Clarifications can have one or more rule categories, so these need to be displayed in the footer in the clarifications list and on the details screen.

2. If you just navigated from a clarification list and you choose to go back from the details screen, that is when we show the last category search list and related clarifications.

3. If you did not navigate to the clarification details page from the category selector, going back should default your categories at the root.

4. When you add a clarification, you need to multiselect categories and you also need to be able to create new categories.

5. If you created the clarification or are an admin, you need to be able to edit and delete the clarification.

6. The clarifications list needs a search and a pager.

7. I need to modify the api to return a list of rule categories for each clarification in the list and on the details page.

8. Research why categories is being activated multiple times.

9. Figure out how to get game into a state when you did not come from one with game present.

10. The home page search needs to autocomplete and allow you to select directly from that dropdown.

12. Game gallery directive needs a pager.
